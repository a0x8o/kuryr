features:
  - |
    Add support for multiple binding drivers. Introduce a new config
    called 'enabled_drivers' which specifies a list of binding drivers
    allowed to use.
deprecations:
  - |
    Rename the config 'driver' to 'default_driver' in 'binding' group.
    This is for making it clear that it is allowed to have more than
    one type of bindings.
